Take Augmented Reality (AR) pictures with protein molecules.

## Hot it works

Under the hood, Molecular uses the [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) library to track the marker and display the 3D model of protein on top of it. Everything happens in the browser, without the need to install any additional software.

## Why the name

The name is a word play on "molecular" and "AR".
